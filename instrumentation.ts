/**
 * Runs once when the server starts. A missing prod setting, a lead store that
 * cannot open, or SMTP with no sender fails startup — every request, `/health`
 * included, answers 500 and the pod never turns ready — instead of the first
 * customer's submission. The lead webhook is built here for the same reason,
 * and started so that what a previous process queued is delivered without
 * waiting for the next lead. Then the experiments this build runs are
 * declared to the panel through that webhook (`experiments.declared@1`), so
 * its "Experiments" screen offers their weights and kill switch
 * (`PANEL_EXPERIMENTS`); that one never fails startup — the panel keeps the
 * last declaration.
