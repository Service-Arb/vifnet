// reached by their `#`; the stats strip and the guarantee have no anchor and
// sit a band away from one, so they load at the top and the runner shoots the
// element. The sticky bar rides the viewport and only after a scroll: it is
// hidden in every crop (screenshot-section.css) rather than shot.
