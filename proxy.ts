 * `ab_<key>` after it); `request.cookies` must already hold `abProxy`'s draw.
 *
 * A forced request takes the URL's arms. A test the URL does not name takes,
 * coming from inside the site, its current cookie: after the logo or the
 * language switch the URL has lost the earlier forces, and the menu's tap
 * adds only its own key, so going by the snapshot would undo the others
 * unasked. Coming from outside, the URL is the whole state — an unnamed test
 * is the visitor's own, so `?ab_lead_channel=a` typed after `?ab_lead_form=b`
 * puts lead_form back.
 *
 * The visitor's own arms are the snapshot in `QA_COOKIE`, taken on the first
 * forced visit (after `abProxy` drew a newcomer's) and never retaken while it
 * lasts, since by then `ab_<key>` holds forced arms. A key the snapshot lacks
 * (a test switched on mid-QA) is taken from the cookie as it stands: no force
 * has touched it yet. The legacy `1` holds no arm and its cookies may be
 * forced, so a force draws the running tests afresh first ({@link qaVisitOf})
 * and saves that draw.
 *
 * The home page with no force keeps QA when the site itself led there (the
 * logo, the language switch, Next's own RSC fetches and prefetches), so a
 * variant can be checked in another language. It ends QA ({@link leavesQa})
 * on an outside entry or the menu's Reset: the own arms come back and the
 * mark goes, the menu with it. A paused test's arm is restored too: a pause
 * keeps every visitor's `ab_<key>`.
