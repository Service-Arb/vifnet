The landing site of Vifnet, a cleaning business in France that works at the
customer's address and has no storefront of its own.

A Next.js app on [`@evinvest/kitstart`](https://github.com/EV-invest/lib/tree/main/ts/kitstart),
the machinery the Service-Arb landings share (routing, the place model and its
publication gate, the quote form and its lead store, SEO), built to the Figma
file `1wXlPmnmOdKYPDWz6N5EB8`, band for band: header, hero with the quote
card, stats, services, reviews, guarantee, FAQ, the gold CTA band, footer and
the sticky bar. French by default, English beside it.

There is no domain and no public phone number yet, so every page is `noindex`,
`robots.txt` disallows everything, the sitemap is empty and the quote form is
the only channel. The facts still missing are listed once, in `OWNER_TODO`
(`src/shared/config/site.ts`); giving the site a domain while a launch-blocking
one is open fails the build. One of them is the design's sample content — the
rating, the reviews, the prices, the phone number and the stock photos the
page shows as the Figma file has them — which the owner replaces before a
launch.

<h2>Installation</h2>
</summary>

The repo builds with Nix. Determinate Nix with `lazy-trees = true` is required.

```sh
nix develop
```

This gives you Node 22, Playwright with its pinned browsers and vips, and
writes the generated files — `.github/workflows/`, `.gitignore`,
`.treefmt.toml` and this README — from `flake.nix`. Edit the flake and
`docs/.readme_assets/`, not them.

Plain npm works for the app itself:

```sh
npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npx vitest run && npm run build && npm run size && npm start
```

</details>
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

## Usage
Start the site:

```sh
nix run .#dev            # http://localhost:59082/fr
```

Run the checks:

```sh
nix run .#test           # tsc, lint (eslint + steiger), vitest, build, size, Playwright
nix run .#size           # first-load JS against tests/bundle_budget.txt — the one hard gate
nix flake check          # the hermetic Nix build and the budget against it
```

Build the server and the container image:

```sh
nix build                # the standalone server
nix build .#container    # OCI image, on Linux
nix run .#container-smoke  # boot it and hold it to its contract (Linux + docker)
```

The image listens on 59082 and keeps leads in `/data`. Its settings come from
`deploy/config.nix`. Pushing a `v*` tag builds the image and publishes it to
`ghcr.io/service-arb/vifnet`: `nix run .#publish` makes the tag.

The palette is `assets/brand.toml`; `npm run palette` regenerates
`app/brand.css` from it, and a test fails when the two disagree. The photos on
the page are cut from `assets/profile_images/` by
`nix shell nixpkgs#vips -c npm run photos`; a test fails when the committed
cuts and `scripts/photos.ts` disagree.

##### Visual baselines

Screenshot baselines are Linux's, because CI is: a mac rasterises glyphs
differently, so locally the pixel comparison is skipped. To refresh them after
changing a section:

1. Run the **Visual baselines** workflow on the branch
   (`gh workflow run visual-baselines.yml --ref <branch>`). Before that workflow
   exists on `main`, a CI run of **Errors** on the branch writes any missing
   baseline and publishes the same artifact.
2. `gh run download <run-id> -n visual-snapshots -D tests/e2e/__screenshots__`
3. Look at the images, then commit them alone:
   `test: refresh visual baselines (run <run-id>)`.

`nix run .#help` prints the list of commands.

## Layout

```text
app/             Next routes, each a few lines over a kitstart factory: pages under
                 [locale]/[location], /quote, /og, /health, robots, sitemap, the global 404
src/             the site in Feature-Sliced layers (shared → entities → features → widgets → views);
                 widgets/ are named after the Figma frames (hero, before-after, services, …)
assets/          brand.toml (the palette), card.toml (contact facts), the mark and lock-up,
                 fonts/, profile_images/ (the portfolio) and photos/ (its web cuts)
scripts/         photos.ts: the AVIF/WebP cuts of the portfolio
tests/           vitest; tests/e2e/ Playwright; bundle_budget.txt
deploy/          production config, authored in Nix
nix/             the generated CI workflows' source
```
