 * The heading, the placeholders (labels only for assistive technology) and
 * the Done state are the frame's; the fields, channels and events are the
 * kit's. No name field: the call back asks it, and every field costs leads. A service card names its service (`data-need`), so the card does not
 * ask it again. The card is `#<id>` (`#devis`), its form `#devis-form`, the
 * callback `#devis-callback`; the form posts `form_id=quote`, the kit's
 * default, so its events stay comparable across brands. A regular clean is
 * an estimate (`FLOWS`): its answers as tiles, the price live on one line
 * with what is left after the tax credit, "Réserver"; the other jobs are
 * quotes, with photos on WhatsApp when the place has it. Under the phone one
 * line says the number stays with us; the other channels are one row.
 * An arm of `lead_channel` (`messenger`) offers WhatsApp and the bot in the
 * card instead (`messengerShape`: its words, its parts, its lede).
